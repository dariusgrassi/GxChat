# GxChat

[![CI](https://github.com/dariusgrassi/GxChat/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dariusgrassi/GxChat/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

GxChat is a cross-platform chat application designed to interact with the GroupMe API. It features a Python (Tkinter) frontend for the user interface and a high-performance Rust (Axum) backend for handling API requests and real-time communication.

## Features

-   **Channel Listing:** View all your GroupMe channels.
-   **Message History:** Display chat history for selected channels, including text and images.
-   **Message Sending:** Send messages to GroupMe channels.
-   **Live Like Updates:** See message likes update in real-time (via polling).
-   **User Information:** Display current user details.
-   **Containerized Backend:** Easy setup and consistent environment for the Rust backend using Docker.
-   **Pre-commit Hooks:** Automated code quality checks for Python (Ruff, MyPy) and Rust (Rustfmt, Clippy).

## Appearance

## Architecture

-   **Frontend:** Python 3.x with Tkinter for the GUI.
-   **Backend:** Rust with the Axum web framework, acting as a proxy to the GroupMe API.
-   **Real-time:** Uses GroupMe's Faye push service for new message notifications and polling for like updates.

## Setup and Running

Follow these steps to get GxChat up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
-   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (for running the Rust backend)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dariusgrassi/GxChat.git
cd GxChat
```

### 2. Run the Backend (Docker)

Navigate to the root of the `GxChat` directory and use Docker Compose to build and run the backend service:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:
-   Build the Rust backend Docker image.
-   Start the backend container, listening on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

Leave this terminal window open, as the backend will be running in the foreground.

### 3. Set up the Frontend (Python)

In a new terminal window, navigate to the root of the `GxChat` directory and install the Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)

To ensure code quality and consistency, install the pre-commit hooks. These will run automatically before each commit.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### 5. Run the Frontend

From the root of the `GxChat` directory, start the Python frontend:

```bash
python main.py
```

The GxChat application window should now appear. You will be prompted to log in with GroupMe via your web browser.
